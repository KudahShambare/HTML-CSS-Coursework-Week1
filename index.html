      <h1>The Cyber Generation</h1>
      
        <div id="intro">
        Our generation is so called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z" target="_blank">Generation Z </a>but personally I call it the cyber generation. I think that it's so called Generation "Z" the last letter of the alphabet for a reason. It is the last generation to use manual machines. All the following generations will be using automated machines as a result of the rise of the mighty <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence-ai.asp" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence</a>. As the tech world is growing there is need for more smart people who have the ability to interact with machines as well as giving them instructions so that they serve us as we desire them to do. The world also need Backend and Frontend Developers who facilitates all our internet activities.

         <h2>AI</h2>
         <p>What is AI? Why AI? Is it good? These are questions a lot of people have in their minds. Some believe that machines will take over the world as they relate Sci-Fi movies with the real tech world. An intelligent machine will not be like a superhero flying in sky. We are always using AI in our day to day lives but sometimes we are unaware of it. Have you ever asked yourself, how does my phone know the people who I frequently chat with? AI is not only in complex machines like spaceships and submarines. We live in it everyday. All our electrical appliances have a form of AI somewhere somehow. So there is a need to build awareness in the society so that everybody will be willing to give a hand in moulding this beautiful craft. The 2 main branches of AI are <a href="https://www.expert.ai/blog/machine-learning-definition/#:~:text=Machine%20learning%20is%20an%20application,use%20it%20learn%20for%20themselves." target="_blank"> Machine Learning</a> and<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deep-learning.asp#:~:text=Deep%20learning%20is%20an%20AI,is%20both%20unstructured%20and%20unlabeled." target="_blank"> Deep Learning.</a> Some people even argue that Deep Learning is a child of Machine Learning but I am not going to take any side on that story. As a person who loves Mathematics and Computing, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/za/data-science/what-is-data-science.html" target="_blank">Data Science</a> is my dream career as it combines the two. <a href="career.html" target="_blank">Click here to read my plan on fulfilling my dream </a> </p>
         <h2>The internet</h2>
         <p>I have been using the internet for a while but I didn't know what it is. It was hard for me to differentiate it from Google and I know up to this date many people are still in that state of mindset. I am not going to explain the differences but <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAqo3-BRDoARIsAE5vnaLOnX9QqujnPv3XHFNr7VJQMbnJY6-ohOaTpEluqQPEVBdEA7xuZBoaAjFuEALw_wcB" >here for the definition of the internet </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">  here to know what is Google.</a></p>
